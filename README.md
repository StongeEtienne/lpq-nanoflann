# Lpq Tree
Fast radius search for a list of MxN matrices, using Lpq entry-wise Minkowski distance. 

Modified version of [Nanoflann](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann) KD Tree with Lpq matrix metric. 

With python binder based of [pynanoflann](https://github.com/u1234x1234/pynanoflann)

Currently focussing on L21 (with 3D points), implementation.
With added pytest.
