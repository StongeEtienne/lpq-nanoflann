# Lpq Tree
Fast radius search for a list of MxN matrices, using Lpq Minkowski "mixed-norm" / "entry-wise matrix distance". 

Currently focussing on L21, for 3D points applications.

Modified version of [Nanoflann](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann) KD Tree with Lpq matrix metric. 
With python binder based of [pynanoflann](https://github.com/u1234x1234/pynanoflann).
